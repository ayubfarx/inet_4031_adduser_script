This project automates user creation on Ubuntu using a Python script. It reads user data from a text file and creates users on the system with the given info. The main files are create-users.py (the script) and create-users.input (the user list). Each line in create-users.input should follow this format: username,password,Full Name — for example: jdoe,password123,John Doe. To use the script, first clone the repo using git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/inet_4031_adduser_script.git and cd into it. Then edit create-users.input to include the users you want. Run the script with sudo python3 create-users.py, or use --dry-run to test it without making changes: sudo python3 create-users.py --dry-run. The script requires Ubuntu 22.04 or later, Python 3, and sudo/root access. This project was created for INET 4031 – Lab 8 Part 2 by Ayub.
